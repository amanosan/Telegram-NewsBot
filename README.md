### This is a Telegram Bot for News.

This bot has been been made using the python-telegram-bot library. <br>
The conversational style has been implemented by using Google Dialogflow. <br>
The News has been fetched from the Google News API - gnewsclient. <br>
The callback URL used for public request is through NGROK.

##### Note:

- Make sure to enter the Telegram Bot Token and the Google Dialogflow Product ID in .sample-env file.
- After putting the above information in, rename the file from '.sample-env' to '.env'
- Make sure to create a Key of your Google Dialogflow in json format and rename that file to 'client.json', I have not uploaded the client.json for obvious reasons.
